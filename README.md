# Bitmex RSI bot
## made with Python in summer 2020



My goal was to make simple and effective bot for bitcoin trading, so this code doesn't contain best coding practices.
The bot worked on google cloud service. I could start up and monitor his action by this system command: "nohup python3 -u rsi_bot.py > logs/rsi_bot.log &".

Trading is always risky, you can loss all your money.
This trading strategy based on RSI isn't profitable.



In the fall of 2020, bitmex started to require user identity confirmation, so I stopped developing this project.
